# USB Rubber Ducky with Raspberry Pi Pico

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to provide the resources that I demonstrated during the IoT Hacking exercises I created for Cisco Live US. The demo is inspited by [pico-ducky](https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky) which allows you to create a USB Rubber Ducky with a Raspberry Pi Pico. This project aims to demonstrate the process of building a USB Rubber Ducky device using the Raspberry Pi Pico, providing an opportunity to explore the inner workings of these devices while highlighting potential risks and promoting responsible use of technology.

## Introduction
The USB Rubber Ducky is a powerful tool that emulates a keyboard to execute commands or automate tasks on a target computer. By leveraging the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico, we can create a cost-effective alternative to the traditional USB Rubber Ducky device.

In this project, we will guide you through the process of building your own USB Rubber Ducky using a Raspberry Pi Pico, providing step-by-step instructions, code samples, and explanations of key concepts along the way.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need the following:
- Raspberry Pi Pico board
- USB cable
- Computer with a USB port
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your computer
- Text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice

## Detailed Instructions
To use the USB Rubber Ducky with Raspberry Pi Pico:
1. Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer using a USB micro cable.
2.
